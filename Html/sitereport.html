           <p> <h1>Project-Introduction</h1>
Web designing is all about using the programming language to create a layout in a web page. This project is also concerned with the skill of using the programming language like Html and css in developing the web page. Through this 
project I am showning my skills of using html and css codes/language to develop a web page. This project has helped me to increase more knowledge in using the programming language.
To make this project successful I have applied my full knowledge of programming language with proper plannig and with best effort to make it a functional and effective.  
This project consist of 5 different web pages those are Home, Portfolio, Contact, Work-Experience and Site-report.</p>
<p>
    <h1>Working on nav bar</h1>
It is the only part that is same in all the pages which contains logo and the element that helps user to move to different page that we want by simply cilcking on the list  that is assigned to the page.
</p>
<p>
    <h1>Home-page</h1>
    Its the first layout page which contain short bio about me. 
 At first I used black background but it was not looking good so I used my own pic as the background which simply looks good as the the web was more about me.
