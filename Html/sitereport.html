           <p> <h1>Project-Introduction</h1>
Web designing is all about using the programming language to create a layout in a web page. This project is also concerned with the skill of using the programming language like Html and CSS. Through this

        <h1>My experience of the module and learning the codes </h1>
        I was very excited to get opportunity to learn the web development module. This module has helped me a lot to gain proper knowledge about coding and to execute the design in the web through the help of coding.
Before joining the module, I had a little knowledge about how to create a web page using html only, but after the exciting jorney of learning the basics of web development, that is html and css in the module, I gained a great skills of implementing the html and css codes together to create a interactive web page.
While learning the codes theoretically and practically, I thought it wasn't that hard, but after doing a practical by myself I was frustrated as the codes I used were not working properly. So, I asked help from our modulator Mr. Chirag Thapa and he helped me with my problems which made me relieved. Overall, the journey of learning the codes in the module was difficult but was rewarding, and I look forward to gain and grow my skills in this field.

    <h1>Working on nav bar</h1>
It is the only part that is same in all the pages which contains logo and the element that helps user to move one page to another by simply cilcking on the list  that is assigned to the page.
</p>
<p>
    <h1>Home-page</h1>
    Its the first layout page which contain short bio about me. 
 At first I used black background but it was not looking good so I used my own picture as the background which simply looks good as the the web was more about me.

</p>
<p>
    <h1>portfolio</h1>
It is the second page of my website which contains the picture thay I clicked 
At first I just randomly placed the photos using different div but its didn't look good so I set margin inorder to make it look like column and added hover effects for micro animation. 
</p>
<p>
    <h1> contact </h1>
    It contains my contact details and a form which lets the user to connect with me. 
    As in all pages I used back, white and aqua blue color cordination so at first I use aqua color as the back-ground in form but it was not looking good so I use black color with different opacity which perfectly match with the theme.
