        <h2>Photographer</h2>
        <p> 
            I have worked as a photographer for 2 years for the local newspaper.
            And I am have my own photo studio. Over the years, I have mainly worked on a single area that is nature. Through the time period as photographer
I have involved in nature so much that it keeps me to chase my dream to capture the nature in photos. One of the best opportunity from my job is that I got chance to know the natura and its beauty and I got chance to get involve in it.
